Welcome to your neonious one!

The program entry point is /src/index.js .

/www/ contains the static files your program serves to the user. The contents
of this directory are not read by the JavaScript runtime on the board, but
rather is read by the program (/src/index.js) and served to the user. Thus, all
JS files in /www/ run in the browser, not on neonious one.

The official documentation of the board can be found at

For any questions, we are happy to help you! Contact us at info@neonious.com at
